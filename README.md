# Obsidian Summarizer Plugin
This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This Plugin allows the user to summarize a section of the currently opened document.
It uses the ChatGPT API to do so.
The user has to register his own ChatGPT API Key in order for this plugin to work.
The ChatGPT API Key can be set after the installation as well as in the settings.

## How to use the plugin
The plugin reads the text below the header with the level 1 called "Dokumentation" and puts the
summary after the header "Summary" at level 1.

This is how it works by default. You can change both header names in the settings.
You can also change the level of the headings in the settings.
